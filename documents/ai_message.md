**General assessment**

**Frontend::** ☆☆☆ (3/5)  
*Comment:*  
- Modular PHP components and CSS organization show good structure
- Lacks responsive design implementation and mobile optimization
- Search functionality works but interface is basic/placeholder-like
- KaTeX integration for math rendering is properly implemented
- No frontend framework usage visible (React/Vue/Angular)

**Backend::** ☆☆☆½ (3.5/5)  
*Comment:*  
- Secure DB connection handling with environment variables
- Prepared statements used correctly for SQL queries
- API endpoints follow REST conventions
- No visible caching mechanisms or rate limiting
- Error handling exists but lacks comprehensive logging

**Security::** ☆☆½ (2.5/5)  
*Comment:*  
- ✅ Positive: SQL injection prevented via prepared statements
- ❌ Concerns: CORS set to wildcard (*), no HTTPS enforcement
- ❌ Missing: CSRF protection, input sanitization beyond basic regex
- ❌ Risk: Session management not visible in provided code
- ❌ Vulnerability: XSS possible through innerHTML usage

**DB::** ☆☆½ (2.5/5)  
*Comment:*  
- ✅ Positive: Normalized data structure with localization support
- ❌ Missing: No visible indexing strategy or query optimization
- ❌ Concern: LIKE operator usage on content could be inefficient
- ❌ Limitation: No schema versioning/migration system visible
- ❌ Risk: SELECT * usage exposes all columns unnecessarily

**Language-specific assessment**

**Markdown** ☆ (0/5)  
*Comment:* No markdown files or markdown processing visible in codebase

**Python** ☆ (0/5)  
*Comment:* No Python files or Python-related functionality implemented

**JSON** ☆☆☆ (3/5)  
*Comment:*  
- Properly used for API responses and data storage
- Missing schema validation for JSON data structures
- No visible use of JSON Web Tokens or advanced JSON features
- JSONC used for configs but without linting/validation

**PHP** ☆☆☆½ (3.5/5)  
*Comment:*  
- Good module separation and environment handling
- Modern OOP approach missing (no composer, namespaces)
- Mixed HTML/PHP could be improved with templating engine
- Error handling needs improvement (exception coverage)

**SVG** ☆☆☆ (3/5)  
*Comment:*  
- Properly used for logos and vector graphics
- No visible optimization (missing SVG sprites/compression)
- No dynamic SVG generation or animation implemented
- Basic implementation without accessibility tags

**JavaScript** ☆☆☆ (3/5)  
*Comment:*  
- Event handling and DOM manipulation implemented correctly
- Missing modern ES6+ features (const/let, arrow functions)
- No framework usage (React/Vue) or module bundling
- Basic error handling with alert() instead of proper UI

**CSS** ☆☆☆ (3/5)  
*Comment:*  
- Good separation of concerns with component CSS
- Missing CSS variables or preprocessor (SASS/LESS)
- No visible responsive design implementation
- Some redundancy in gradient definitions
- Modern features like grid/flex underutilized

**Recommendations Summary:**  
1. Implement frontend framework and build process  
2. Add comprehensive input validation/sanitization  
3. Introduce proper authentication/authorization  
4. Implement DB indexing and query optimization  
5. Add HTTPS enforcement and security headers  
6. Modernize JS with ES6+ and module system  
7. Implement proper error logging/monitoring  
8. Add responsive design and accessibility features
